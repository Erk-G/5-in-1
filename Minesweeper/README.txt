My second out of five swing "games", unfinished for now. Definitely coming back after I learn to place images properly.

Major bugs-
If you win you die.

Things to add-
A winning state
Actual visuals. A number appearing instead of a pop up window. Showing where all the bombs are when you lose.
Difficulties, where chossing a higher one makes a bigger square so instead of a 4x4 its a 11x11 for medium or something.
Being able to mark mines.
